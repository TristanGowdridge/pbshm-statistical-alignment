I've only uploaded the TL stuff for flask core.

Obviously you'll need to clone this and add it to your flask core installation and change the init file to include the module.

All the data should be inside the folder transferlearning/OfflineData

I think the only package I added was numpy, but if ive missed some im sorry. I didnt want to include all the pip freeze.
